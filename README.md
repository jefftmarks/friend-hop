# Friend Hop

This app was created in August 2022 by by [Jeff](https://github.com/jefftmarks) and [Sky](https://github.com/eliz-is-newb) as part of a project to practice frontend web development.

The frontend is built on Javascript and React. The backend is a mock API generated by [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).


## What is it?
This project is a social media emulator where a user 
can share uploaded song links (via SoundCloud), add and view friends, send messages, and express themselves with preset custom avatar moods.
